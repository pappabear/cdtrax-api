	Step 2 - Starting the API...
------------------------------------------------
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 5.0.6 application starting in development on http://localhost:3001
=> Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
Puma starting in single mode...
* Version 3.11.3 (ruby 2.2.5-p319), codename: Love Song
* Min threads: 5, max threads: 5
* Environment: development
* Listening on tcp://localhost:3001
Use Ctrl-C to stop
